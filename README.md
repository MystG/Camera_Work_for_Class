# Camera_Work_for_Class

This is just the camera work used in a performance piece for the class I am taking called "Art and Code for Interactivity"

Setup:
  This is a game.
  The player sits in front of a computer with the program running (it's basically a camera app where the camera is facing the player)
  The player also has a set of cards in front of them with light silhouettes of diverse things (characters, objects, actions)
  The player also has to choose the appropriate card that answers the riddle the gamemaster (gm) is using. 
  5 points to win (or like 2/3 of the total number of cards. up to the gm).
  
  The gm stands elsewhere, looking at the camera through a feed of some sort.
  They look to see if the player's choice is correct and they appoint points
